\chapter{SLA - Lightly cluttered room}
\label{app:sla}

Each figure in this appendix shows the distance between the tag real position and the tag estimated position by the \gls{sla}. Each simulation has been made in the same room, the room in Fig. \ref{fig:room_cluttered} with the blue furniture. The anchor has been set at different position for each simulation.
