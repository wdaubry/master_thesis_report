\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First, I would like to thank my promoter, François Quitin, for giving me the opportunity of making my Master Thesis about such an interesting topic. For the relevant advices throughout the year and the continuous monitoring of my work.
I would also like to thank Michel Osée and Cédric Hannotier for the time spent helping me with the, sometimes temperamental, material. On a personal side, I would like to thank my parents, for the continuous support through my university years. I would also like to thank Thèrèse Bayet, for the many hours spent improving my British language used in this thesis in a short time frame. Finally, I would like to thank my favorite 'colleague' Matia, for the countless hours spent discussing, studying and motivating each other. Last but not least, Denis, for his trust in me, for encouraging me to conclude this thesis and always being present when needed.
