\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First, I would like to thank my promoter, François Quitin, for giving me the opportunity of making my Master Thesis on such an interesting topic. For the relevant advices throughout the year and the continuous monitoring of my work.
I would also like to thank Michel Osée and Cédric Hannotier for the time spent helping me with the, sometimes temperamental, material. On a personal side, I would like to thank my parent, for the continuous support through my university years. I would also like to thank Thèrèse, for the many hours spent rereading this thesis in a short time frame. Finally, I would thank my favorite 'colleague' Matia, for the countless hours discussing, studying and motivating each other. Last but not least, Denis, for the belief placed in me, for encouraging me to conclude this thesis and always being present when needed.
